# MCP Swarm System - Claude Desktop Integration

## ✅ Corrected Understanding

You are absolutely correct! This system is designed to work with **Claude Desktop**, not the Claude API.

## How It Actually Works

### 🎯 MCP Server Architecture
Each agent in the swarm runs as an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** that Claude Desktop can connect to:

```
Claude Desktop ←→ MCP Server (Agent)
     ↑                ↓
  User Interface   Specialized AI Agent
                   (Architect, Frontend, etc.)
```

### 🔧 Agent Configuration
Each agent:
- Runs as a Docker container
- Exposes an MCP server endpoint
- Has specialized capabilities and tools
- Can be accessed through Claude Desktop

### 🌐 System Architecture
```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐

         └────────────────────────┼────────────────────────┘
                                  │
                            ┌─────────────────┐
                            │   Dashboard     │
                            │  (Monitoring)   │
                            └─────────────────┘
```

## 🚀 Updated Setup Process

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Claude Desktop** (download from claude.ai/download)
- Docker & Docker Compose
- No API keys required for basic operation

### 2. Start the MCP Swarm
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. Configure Claude Desktop
Add the MCP servers from `config/claude-desktop-config.json` to your Claude Desktop settings.

### 4. Use Your Specialized Agents
In Claude Desktop, you can now:
- Ask the **Architect** to plan your project
- Have the **Frontend** agent help with UI design
- Get the **Backend** agent to design APIs
- Use the **DevOps** agent for infrastructure
- Let the **QA** agent create test plans
- Have the **Docs** agent write documentation

## 🎯 Key Benefits

### For Claude Desktop Users
- **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent is an expert in their domain
- **Persistent Context**: Agents maintain project context across sessions
- **Tool Integration**: Agents have access to specialized tools and databases
- **Collaborative**: Agents can coordinate with each other

### For Development Teams
- **No API Costs**: Uses Claude Desktop, not API calls
- **Local Control**: All agents run locally in Docker
- **Customizable**: Each agent can be configured for specific needs
- **Scalable**: Add new agent types as needed

## 📊 Monitoring & Management

The React dashboard (http://localhost:8080) provides:
- Real-time agent status monitoring
- Task assignment and tracking
- Project progress visualization
- System metrics and health checks

## 🔍 What Changed

### Removed:
- ❌ Claude API key requirements
- ❌ Direct API calls to Anthropic
- ❌ API-based agent interactions

### Added:
- ✅ MCP server endpoints for each agent
- ✅ Claude Desktop integration configuration
- ✅ Local-first architecture
- ✅ No external API dependencies for core functionality

## 🎉 Result

You now have a powerful MCP-based AI agent swarm that integrates seamlessly with Claude Desktop, providing specialized AI assistants for every aspect of development work - all running locally without API costs!

Each agent brings domain expertise and can access specialized tools while maintaining context and coordination through the shared infrastructure.

# Dashboard Issues Fixed

## Overview
Fixed multiple critical issues in the MCP Swarm Dashboard affecting Tasks, Settings, and Metrics pages.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Tasks Page Issues

#### Problem: Agent selection not retained after task creation
**Solution**: Modified the task creation handler to keep the agent selection:
- Changed `handleCreateTask` to retain the `agent` value in the form state
- Users can now create multiple tasks for the same agent without re-selecting

#### Problem: No way to edit tasks
**Solution**: Added comprehensive task editing functionality:
- Added `handleEditTask`, `handleUpdateTask` functions
- Created edit dialog with all task fields (agent, title, description, priority, type)
- Added edit button (pencil icon) in the actions column
- Added API endpoint `PUT /api/tasks/:taskId` in server.js

#### Problem: Date displayed as "Invalid Date"
**Solution**: Enhanced date formatting with robust error handling:
- Improved `formatDate` function to handle multiple date formats
- Added support for ISO strings, timestamps, and malformed dates
- Added error handling and fallback to "Invalid Date" for unparseable dates

#### Problem: Action buttons don't work
**Solution**: Implemented functional action buttons:
- Added `handleTaskAction` function to handle start, pause, stop, cancel actions
- Connected all action buttons to actual API endpoints
- Added API endpoints `POST /api/tasks/:taskId/:action` in server.js
- Added visual feedback with toast notifications
- Added proper task refresh after actions

#### Additional Improvements:
- Added task details view dialog with complete task information
- Improved action button visibility based on task status
- Added proper error handling and user feedback

### 2. Settings Page Issues

#### Problem: System preferences not retained
**Solution**: Implemented persistent settings using localStorage:
- Settings are automatically saved to localStorage when changed
- Settings are loaded from localStorage on component initialization
- Added `useEffect` hook to save settings whenever they change
- Improved user feedback with "Setting saved successfully" message

#### Additional Improvements:
- Added "Reset All Settings" button to restore defaults
- Enhanced settings organization and clarity
- Improved error handling for localStorage operations

### 3. Metrics Page Issues

#### Problem: Most metrics were fake/mock data
**Solution**: Replaced all fake data with real metrics from actual system state:
- **Total Tasks**: Now calculated from actual pending + completed tasks
- **Completion Rate**: Real percentage based on actual task data
- **Active Agents**: Counts agents that are actually online/active
- **Time Series Data**: Generated from actual task creation/completion dates
- **Agent Performance**: Real data showing actual task assignments and completions
- **System Health**: Real uptime and status indicators based on agent states

#### Specific Changes:
- Replaced mock `generateTimeSeriesData()` with real date-based filtering
- Updated agent activity to show actual task assignments and completions
- Changed system health metrics to reflect real system status
- Improved status indicators to show actual agent states

### 4. Backend API Enhancements

#### Added New Endpoints:
- `PUT /api/tasks/:taskId` - Update task details
- `POST /api/tasks/:taskId/:action` - Handle task actions (start, pause, stop, cancel)

#### Added New Server Methods:
- `handleTaskAction()` - Processes task state changes
- Enhanced error handling and validation
- Added proper Redis publishing for real-time updates

### 5. Infrastructure Improvements

#### Auto-Refresh System:
- Created `useAutoRefresh` hook for configurable automatic data refreshing
- Respects user settings for refresh interval and enable/disable
- Reduces unnecessary API calls and improves performance

#### Enhanced Socket Context:
- Converted functions to `useCallback` for better performance
- Added settings-aware auto-refresh
- Improved dependency management in useEffect hooks
- Better error handling and logging

#### User Experience:
- Replaced page reloads with smooth data refreshing
- Added proper loading states and error feedback
- Improved toast notifications for user actions
- Enhanced visual feedback for all interactions

## Technical Details

### File Changes:
1. **TasksView.js**: Complete overhaul with edit functionality, action handlers, and improved date formatting
2. **SettingsView.js**: Added localStorage persistence and reset functionality
3. **MetricsView.js**: Replaced all mock data with real metrics calculations
4. **SocketContext.js**: Enhanced with auto-refresh and better state management
5. **server.js**: Added new API endpoints and task management methods
6. **useAutoRefresh.js**: New custom hook for configurable auto-refresh

### Key Features Added:
- Persistent user settings
- Real-time task editing and management
- Comprehensive task action handling (start, pause, stop, cancel)
- Real metrics and analytics
- Configurable auto-refresh system
- Improved error handling throughout

### Performance Improvements:
- Reduced unnecessary re-renders with useCallback
- Intelligent auto-refresh based on user preferences
- Eliminated full page reloads in favor of targeted data updates
- Better caching and state management

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test task creation and editing** with various agent assignments
2. **Verify settings persistence** by changing settings and refreshing the page
3. **Check metrics accuracy** by creating and completing tasks
4. **Test action buttons** for different task states
5. **Validate auto-refresh behavior** with different interval settings
6. **Test error handling** by disconnecting from the backend

All issues have been resolved with proper error handling, user feedback, and real-time updates.
